     <h1>Introduction to NODEJS</h1>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
        It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its high performance.
        Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications, particularly server-side applications, but can also be used for command-line tools and desktop applications.
         It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model,which allows it to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. This makes it suitable for real-time applications, APIs, and microservices.
