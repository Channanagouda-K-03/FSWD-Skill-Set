     <h1>Introduction to JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and popular scripting language primarily used for adding interactive and dynamic functionality to web pages. 
        It's a high-level, interpreted language that runs in the user's web browser, making it essential for front-end development. 
        JavaScript can also be used for server-side development and other applications like mobile apps, browser extensions, and even virtual reality experiences.
