     <h1>Introduction to DJANGO</h1>
    <p>Django
    Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python.
    It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which promotes clean design and rapid development.
    Django provides a structured approach to building web applications, offering built-in features like user authentication, an admin panel, and database management tools.
