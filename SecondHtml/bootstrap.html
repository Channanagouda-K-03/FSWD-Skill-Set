     <h1>Introduction to BOOTSTRAP</h1>
    <p>Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for creating responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. 
        It was initially developed at Twitter and has since become a widely used tool in the web development community.
